A project with main purpose to demonstrate [ngx-signalr](https://github.com/neistow/ngx-signalr) functionality.

Also here I experimented with CQRS + Event driven architecture on a server side.

## Technologies used:

  * [Asp Net Core](https://asp.net)
  * [SignalR](https://signalr.net)
  * [Redis](https://redis.io/)
  * [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  * [ngx-signalr](https://github.com/neistow/ngx-signalr)
